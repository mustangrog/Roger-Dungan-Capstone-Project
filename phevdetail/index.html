          Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles–known as PHEVs–combine a gasoline or diesel engine 
          with an electric motor and a large rechargeable battery. Unlike conventional hybrids, 
          PHEVs can be plugged-in and recharged from an outlet, allowing them to drive extended 
          distances using just electricity. When the battery is emptied, 
          the conventional engine turns on and the vehicle operates as a conventional, non-plug-in 
          hybrid.
          <br>
          <br>
          Because they can run on electricity from the grid—and because electricity is often a 
          cleaner energy source than gasoline or diesel—plug-in hybrids can produce significantly 
          less global warming pollution than their gas-only counterparts. They don't emit any 
          tailpipe pollution when driving on electricity, and they gain fuel efficiency benefits 
          from having an electric motor and battery. Since they use less gas, they also cost less 
          to fuel: driving a PHEV can save hundreds of dollars a year in gasoline and diesel costs.
          <br>
          <br>
          To take advantage of plug-in hybrid vehicles, drivers need access to parking and a place 
          to plug-in, though a regular 120V outlet is usually sufficient. And since most PHEVs are 
          passenger cars, prospective buyers shouldn't regularly require space for more than five 
          occupants, and they shouldn't need to tow. For a list of PHEV vehicles, please click

          While not all models work the same way, most plug-ins can operate in at least two modes: 
          "all-electric," in which the motor and battery provide all of the car's energy; and 
          "hybrid," in which both electricity and gasoline are used. PHEVs typically startup in 
          all-electric mode, running on electricity until their battery pack is depleted: ranges 
          vary from 10 miles to over 40. Certain models switch to hybrid mode when they reach 
          highway cruising speed, generally above 60 or 70 miles per hour. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The electric motor and battery help PHEVs use less fuel and produce less pollution than 
          conventional cars, even when in hybrid mode. Idle-off turns off the engine while idling 
          at stoplights or in traffic, saving fuel. Regenerative braking converts some of the energy 
          lost during braking into usable electricity, stored in the batteries. And because the electric 
          motor supplements the engine's power, smaller engines can be used, increasing the car's fuel 
          efficiency without compromising performance.
