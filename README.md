#Roger-Dungan-Capstone-Project

**Documentation**

**Definition of audience**-This project is intended for people that are considering purchasing an Electric Vehicle (EV).  This web app will include some educational items as well as help them decide based on their driving styles and needs.

**Statement**-I want to create a web app that explains the differences in electric vehicle models to help consumers decide if an EV is right for them and choose the correct model for their needs.

**High Level Story**-With fossil fuels diminishing, Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) vehicles will inevitability be replaced with Elect Vehicles (EVs). My web app will try to dispel myths of EVs, explain the pros and cons of owning an EV, and help those interested in an EV choose the correct type and model depending on their range and charging needs.
