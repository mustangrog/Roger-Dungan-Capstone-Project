        <p>Hello, My name is Roger.  I am an avid gear-head having restored and
            hot-rodded many vehicles. I have also worked in the automotive world
            for over 25 years, most of those at a Chrysler Dealership.  I have 
            seen many changes and advancements in automotive technology over 
            time.  In fact, if you could have told me 10 years ago that I would
            be driving an electric car, there's no way I would have believed you!  
            But, I've come to realize that we are destroying the planet we live
            on.  If the human race doesn't do something before too long, future 
            generations won't have a planet to live on.  I still wouldn't call
            myself a 'Tree-hugger', just one person trying to make a difference
            in the world.  I bought a Chevy Volt (PHEV) and I don't think I will
            ever go back to a normal Internal Combution Engine (ICE) vehicle.  
            Not only are Electric Vehicles (EVs) cheaper to operate, they will
            save you money, in the long run, with maintenance costs.  
            <br>
            <br>
            I also have just begun to dabble in alternative energy solutions,
            mainly solar.  I'm slowly purchasing the components necessary to 
            install a grid-tie solar array to charge my EV and offset my monthly
            electric usage.  
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you very much for taking the time to check out my site.  I hope
            you find it informative and it helps you decide first off if an EV 
            is right for you, and if so, help you choose the right one for your
            lifestyle.
        </p>
