          height="200" alt="image of myself" title="Me!">Hello, My name is Roger.  
          I am an avid gear-head having restored and
          hot-rodded many vehicles. I have also worked in the automotive world
          for over 25 years, most of those at a Chrysler Dealership.  I have 
          seen many changes and advancements in automotive technology over 
          time.  In fact, if you could have told me 10 years ago that I would
          be driving an electric car, there's no way I would have believed you!  
          But, I've come to realize that we are destroying the planet we live
          on.  If the human race doesn't do something before too long, future 
          generations won't have a planet to live on.  I still wouldn't call
          myself a 'Tree-hugger', just one person trying to make a difference
          in the world.

          <img src="../images/voltutah.jpeg" class="aboutVolt" width="320" 
          height="240" alt="image of my Chevy Volt" title="My Chevy Volt">I 
          purchased a Chevy Volt (PHEV) 5 years ago and I don't think I will
          ever go back to a normal Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicle.  
          Not only are Electric Vehicles (EVs) cheaper to operate, they will
          save you money, in the long run, with maintenance costs.  My goal,
          in the not too distant future, is to own a Tesla Model 3.  
          <br>
          <br>
          I also have just begun to dabble in alternative energy solutions,
          mainly solar.  I'm slowly purchasing the components necessary to 
          install a grid-tie solar array to charge my EV and offset my monthly
          electric usage.  I'm sure it will be an ongoing project as I would love
          to build my own version of a Tesla Powerwall (A battery storage system
          that will store any excess power produced by the solar panels during the
          day and supply power at night without reliance on the grid).

          Thank you very much for taking the time to check out my site.  I hope
          you find it informative and it helps you decide first off if an EV 
          is right for you, and if so, help you choose the right one for your
          lifestyle.
