              <h2>Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)</h2>
              <p>
                  <strong>A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)</strong> is a type of 
                  hybrid vehicle thatcombines a conventional internal combustion 
                  engine (ICE) system with an electric propulsion system (hybrid vehicle drivetrain). 
                  The presence of the electric powertrain is intended to achieve 
                  either better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle or better 
                  performance. There is a variety of HEV types, and the degree to 
                  which each functions as an electric vehicle (EV) also varies. 
                  The most common form of HEV is the hybrid electric car, although 
                  hybrid electric trucks (pickups and tractors) and buses also exist.
                  <br>
                  Modern HEVs make use of efficiency-improving technologies such as 
                  regenerative brakes which convert the vehicle's kinetic energy to 
                  electric energy, which is stored in a battery or supercapacitor. 
                  Some varieties of HEV use an internal combustion engine to turn an 
                  electrical generator, which either recharges the vehicle's batteries 
                  or directly powers its electric drive motors; this combination is 
                  known as a motorâ€“generator. Many HEVs reduce idle emissions by shutting 
                  down the engine at idle and restarting it when needed; this is known as 
                  a start-stop system. A hybrid-electric produces less tailpipe emissions 
                  than a comparably sized gasoline car, since the hybrid's gasoline 
                  engine is usually smaller than that of a gasoline-powered vehicle. 
                  If the engine is not used to drive the car directly, it can be geared 
                  to run at maximum efficiency, further improving fuel economy.
                  <br>
                  <strong>Types of Powertrains:</strong>
                  <br>
                  In parallel hybrids, the ICE and the electric motor are both connected to
                  the mechanical transmission and can simultaneously transmit power to drive 
                  the wheels, usually through a conventional transmission. Honda's Integrated 
                  Motor Assist (IMA) system as found in the Insight, Civic, Accord, as well 
                  as the GM Belted Alternator/Starter (BAS Hybrid) system found in the Chevrolet 
                  Malibu hybrids are examples of production parallel hybrids. The internal 
                  combustion engine of many parallel hybrids can also act as a generator for 
                  supplemental recharging. As of 2013, commercialized parallel hybrids use a full 
                  size combustion engine with a single, small (less than 20 kW) electric motor and 
                  small battery pack as the electric motor is designed to supplement the main engine, 
                  not to be the sole source of motive power from launch. But after 2015 parallel 
                  hybrids with over 50 kW are available, enabling electric driving at moderate 
                  acceleration. Parallel hybrids are more efficient than comparable non-hybrid 
                  vehicles especially during urban stop-and-go conditions where the electric motor 
                  is permitted to contribute, and during highway operation.
                  <br>
                  In series hybrids, only the electric motor drives the drivetrain, and a smaller 
                  ICE (also called range extender) works as a generator to power the electric motor 
                  or to recharge the batteries. They also usually have a larger battery pack than 
                  parallel hybrids, making them more expensive. Once the batteries are low, the small 
                  combustion engine can generate power at its optimum settings at all times, making 
                  them more efficient in extensive city driving.
                  <br>
                  Power-split hybrids have the benefits of a combination of series and parallel 
                  characteristics. As a result, they are more efficient overall, because series 
                  hybrids tend to be more efficient at lower speeds and parallel tend to be more 
                  efficient at high speeds; however, the cost of power-split hybrid is higher than 
                  a pure parallel. Examples of power-split (referred to by some as "series-parallel") 
                  hybrid powertrains include 2007 models of Ford, General Motors, Lexus, Nissan, 
                  and Toyota.
