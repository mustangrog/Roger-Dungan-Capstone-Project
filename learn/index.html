              <h2>HEV</h2>
              <p>
                  <strong>A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)</strong> is a type of 
                  hybrid vehicle that combines a conventional internal combustion 
                  engine (ICE) system with an electric propulsion system (hybrid vehicle drivetrain). 
                  The presence of the electric powertrain is intended to achieve 
                  either better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle or better 
                  performance. There is a variety of HEV types, and the degree to 
                  which each functions as an electric vehicle (EV) also varies. 
                  The most common form of HEV is the hybrid electric car, although 
                  hybrid electric trucks (pickups and tractors) and buses also exist.
                  <br>

                  <br>
                  Modern HEVs make use of efficiency-improving technologies such as 
                  regenerative brakes which convert the vehicle's kinetic energy to 
                  electric energy, which is stored in a battery or supercapacitor. 
                  Some varieties of HEV use an internal combustion engine to turn an 
                  electrical generator, which either recharges the vehicle's batteries 
                  or directly powers its electric drive motors; this combination is 
                  known as a motorâ€“generator. Many HEVs reduce idle emissions by shutting 
                  down the engine at idle and restarting it when needed; this is known as 
                  a start-stop system. A hybrid-electric produces less tailpipe emissions 
                  than a comparably sized gasoline car, since the hybrid's gasoline 
                  engine is usually smaller than that of a gasoline-powered vehicle. 
                  If the engine is not used to drive the car directly, it can be geared 
                  to run at maximum efficiency, further improving fuel economy.

                  <strong>Types of Powertrains:</strong>
                  <br>
                  In parallel hybrids, the ICE and the electric motor are both connected to
                  the mechanical transmission and can simultaneously transmit power to drive 
                  the wheels, usually through a conventional transmission. Honda's Integrated 
                  Motor Assist (IMA) system as found in the Insight, Civic, Accord, as well 
                  as the GM Belted Alternator/Starter (BAS Hybrid) system found in the Chevrolet 
                  Malibu hybrids are examples of production parallel hybrids. The internal 
                  combustion engine of many parallel hybrids can also act as a generator for 
                  supplemental recharging. As of 2013, commercialized parallel hybrids use a full 
                  size combustion engine with a single, small (less than 20 kW) electric motor and 
                  small battery pack as the electric motor is designed to supplement the main engine, 
                  not to be the sole source of motive power from launch. But after 2015 parallel 
                  hybrids with over 50 kW are available, enabling electric driving at moderate 
                  acceleration. Parallel hybrids are more efficient than comparable non-hybrid 
                  vehicles especially during urban stop-and-go conditions where the electric motor 
                  is permitted to contribute, and during highway operation.
                  <br>
                  In series hybrids, only the electric motor drives the drivetrain, and a smaller 
                  ICE (also called range extender) works as a generator to power the electric motor 
                  or to recharge the batteries. They also usually have a larger battery pack than 
                  parallel hybrids, making them more expensive. Once the batteries are low, the small 
                  combustion engine can generate power at its optimum settings at all times, making 
                  them more efficient in extensive city driving.
                  <br>
                  Power-split hybrids have the benefits of a combination of series and parallel 
                  characteristics. As a result, they are more efficient overall, because series 
                  hybrids tend to be more efficient at lower speeds and parallel tend to be more 
                  efficient at high speeds; however, the cost of power-split hybrid is higher than 
                  a pure parallel. Examples of power-split (referred to by some as "series-parallel") 
                  hybrid powertrains include 2007 models of Ford, General Motors, Lexus, Nissan, 
                  and Toyota.

              <h2>PHEV</h2>
              <p>
                  A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is a hybrid electric vehicle whose battery 
                  can be recharged by plugging it into an external source of electric power, as well 
                  by its on-board engine and generator. Most PHEVs are passenger cars, but there are 
                  also PHEV versions of commercial vehicles and vans, utility trucks, buses, trains, 
                  motorcycles, scooters, and military vehicles.
                <br>
                  Similarly to all-electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids displace emissions from the car 
                  tailpipe to the generators powering the electricity grid. These generators may be 
                  renewable, or may have lower emission than an internal combustion engine. Charging 
                  the battery from the grid can cost less than using the on-board engine, helping to 
                  reduce operating cost.
                <br>
                  Mass-produced plug-in hybrids were available to the public in China and the United 
                  States in 2010. By the end of 2017, there were over 40 models of series-
                  production highway legal plug-in hybrids for retail sales. Plug-in hybrid cars are 
                  available mainly in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, and China. 
                  The top-selling models are the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, the Chevrolet Volt family, 
                  and the Toyota Prius PHV.
                <br>
                  As of December 2018, the global stock of plug-in hybrid cars totaled 1.8 million units, 
                  out of 5.1 million plug-in electric passenger cars on the world roads at the end of 2018.
                  As of December 2017, the United States ranked as the world's largest plug-in 
                  hybrid car market with a stock of 360,510 units, followed by China with 276,580 
                  vehicles, and Japan with 100,860 units.
                <br>
                  PHEVs are based on the same three basic powertrain architectures of conventional hybrids; 
                  a series hybrid is propelled by electric motors only, a parallel hybrid is propelled both 
                  by its engine and by electric motors operating concurrently, and a series-parallel hybrid 
                  operates in either mode. While a plain hybrid vehicle charges its battery from its engine 
                  only, a plug-in hybrid can obtain a significant amount of the energy required to recharge 
                  its battery from external sources.
                <br>
                  The battery charger can be on-board or external to the vehicle. The process for an on-board 
                  charger is best explained as AC power being converted into DC power, resulting in the battery 
                  being charged.[9] On-board chargers are limited in capacity by their weight and size, and by 
                  the limited capacity of general-purpose AC outlets. Dedicated off-board chargers can be as 
                  large and powerful as the user can afford, but require returning to the charger; high-speed 
                  chargers may be shared by multiple vehicles.
                <br>
                  Using the electric motor's inverter allows the motor windings to act as the transformer coils, 
                  and the existing high-power inverter as the AC-to-DC charger. As these components are already 
                  required on the car, and are designed to handle any practical power capability, they can 
                  be used to create a very powerful form of on-board charger with no significant additional 
                  weight or size. AC Propulsion uses this charging method, referred to as "reductive charging".

              <h2>BEV</h2>
              <p>
                  Battery Electric Vehicles, also called BEVs, and more frequently called EVs, are fully-electric 
                  vehicles with rechargeable batteries and no gasoline engine. Battery electric vehicles store 
                  electricity onboard with high-capacity battery packs. Their battery power is used to run the 
                  electric motor and all onboard electronics. BEVs do not emit any harmful emissions and hazards 
                  caused by traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. BEVs are charged by electricity from an 
                  external source. Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers are classified according to the speed with 
                  which they recharge an EVs battery.
                <br>
                  The classifications are Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 or DC fast charging. Level 1 EV charging 
                  uses a standard household (120v) outlet to plug into the electric vehicle and takes over 8 
                  hours to charge an EV for approximately 75-80 miles. Level one charging is typically done at 
                  home or at your workplace. Level 1 chargers have the capability to charge most EVs on the market.
                <br>
                  Level 2 charging requires a specialized station which provides power at 240v. Level 2 chargers 
                  are typically found at workplaces and public charging stations and will take about 4 hours to 
                  charge a battery to 75-80 miles of range.
                <br>
                  Level 3 charging, DC fast charging, or simply fast charging is currently the fastest charging 
                  solution in the EV market. DC fast chargers are found at dedicated EV charging stations and 
                  charge a battery up to 90 miles range in approximately 30 minutes.
                <br>
                  As of April 2018, the world's top selling highway legal all-electric car in history is 
                  the Nissan Leaf with global sales of over 300,000 units, followed by the Tesla Model S 
                  with more than 200,000 units delivered worldwide.
