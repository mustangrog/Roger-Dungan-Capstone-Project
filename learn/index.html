              <h2>HEV</h2>
              <p>
                  <strong>A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)</strong> is a type of 
                  hybrid vehicle that combines a conventional internal combustion 
                  engine (ICE) system with an electric propulsion system (hybrid vehicle drivetrain). 
                  The presence of the electric powertrain is intended to achieve 
                  either better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle or better 
                  performance. There is a variety of HEV types, and the degree to 
                  which each functions as an electric vehicle (EV) also varies. 
                  The most common form of HEV is the hybrid electric car, although 
                  hybrid electric trucks (pickups and tractors) and buses also exist.
                  <br>
                  <img src="../prius.jpg" class="learnPrius" alt="image of Toyota Prius" title="A Toyota Prius">
                  <br>
                  Modern HEVs make use of efficiency-improving technologies such as 
                  regenerative brakes which convert the vehicle's kinetic energy to 
                  electric energy, which is stored in a battery or supercapacitor. 
                  Some varieties of HEV use an internal combustion engine to turn an 
                  electrical generator, which either recharges the vehicle's batteries 
                  or directly powers its electric drive motors; this combination is 
                  known as a motorâ€“generator. Many HEVs reduce idle emissions by shutting 
                  down the engine at idle and restarting it when needed; this is known as 
                  a start-stop system. A hybrid-electric produces less tailpipe emissions 
                  than a comparably sized gasoline car, since the hybrid's gasoline 
                  engine is usually smaller than that of a gasoline-powered vehicle. 
                  If the engine is not used to drive the car directly, it can be geared 
                  to run at maximum efficiency, further improving fuel economy.

                  <strong>Types of Powertrains:</strong>
                  <br>
                  In parallel hybrids, the ICE and the electric motor are both connected to
                  the mechanical transmission and can simultaneously transmit power to drive 
                  the wheels, usually through a conventional transmission. Honda's Integrated 
                  Motor Assist (IMA) system as found in the Insight, Civic, Accord, as well 
                  as the GM Belted Alternator/Starter (BAS Hybrid) system found in the Chevrolet 
                  Malibu hybrids are examples of production parallel hybrids. The internal 
                  combustion engine of many parallel hybrids can also act as a generator for 
                  supplemental recharging. As of 2013, commercialized parallel hybrids use a full 
                  size combustion engine with a single, small (less than 20 kW) electric motor and 
                  small battery pack as the electric motor is designed to supplement the main engine, 
                  not to be the sole source of motive power from launch. But after 2015 parallel 
                  hybrids with over 50 kW are available, enabling electric driving at moderate 
                  acceleration. Parallel hybrids are more efficient than comparable non-hybrid 
                  vehicles especially during urban stop-and-go conditions where the electric motor 
                  is permitted to contribute, and during highway operation.
                  <br>
                  In series hybrids, only the electric motor drives the drivetrain, and a smaller 
                  ICE (also called range extender) works as a generator to power the electric motor 
                  or to recharge the batteries. They also usually have a larger battery pack than 
                  parallel hybrids, making them more expensive. Once the batteries are low, the small 
                  combustion engine can generate power at its optimum settings at all times, making 
                  them more efficient in extensive city driving.
                  <br>
                  Power-split hybrids have the benefits of a combination of series and parallel 
                  characteristics. As a result, they are more efficient overall, because series 
                  hybrids tend to be more efficient at lower speeds and parallel tend to be more 
                  efficient at high speeds; however, the cost of power-split hybrid is higher than 
                  a pure parallel. Examples of power-split 
                  hybrid powertrains include 2007 models of Ford, General Motors, Lexus, Nissan, 
                  and Toyota.

              <h2>PHEV</h2>
              <p>
                  A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is a hybrid electric vehicle whose battery 
                  can be recharged by plugging it into an external source of electric power, as well 
                  by its on-board engine and generator. Most PHEVs are passenger cars, but there are 
                  also PHEV versions of commercial vehicles and vans, utility trucks, buses, trains, 
                  motorcycles, scooters, and military vehicles.
                <br>
                  Similarly to all-electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids displace emissions from the car 
                  tailpipe to the generators powering the electricity grid. These generators may be 
                  renewable, or may have lower emission than an internal<img src="../voltnuke.jpeg" 
                  class="learnVolt" alt="image of Chevy Volt" title="A chevy Volt"> combustion engine. 
                  Charging the battery from the grid can cost less than using the on-board engine, helping to 
                  reduce operating cost.
                <br>
                  Mass-produced plug-in hybrids were available to the public in China and the United 
                  States in 2010. By the end of 2017, there were over 40 models of series-
                  production highway legal plug-in hybrids for retail sales. Plug-in hybrid cars are 
                  available mainly in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, and China. 
                  The top-selling models are the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, the Chevrolet Volt family, 
                  and the Toyota Prius PHV.
                <br>
                  As of December 2018, the global stock of plug-in hybrid cars totaled 1.8 million units, 
                  out of 5.1 million plug-in electric passenger cars on the world roads at the end of<img 
                  src="../pacifica.jpg" class="learnPacifica" 
                  alt="image of Chrysler Pacifica" title="A Chrysler Pacifica"> 2018.
                  As of December 2017, the United States ranked as the world's largest plug-in 
                  hybrid car market with a stock of 360,510 units, followed by China with 276,580 
                  vehicles, and Japan with 100,860 units.
                <br>
                  PHEVs are based on the same three basic powertrain architectures of conventional hybrids; 
                  a series hybrid is propelled by electric motors only, a parallel hybrid is propelled both 
                  by its engine and by electric motors operating concurrently, and a series-parallel hybrid 
                  operates in either mode. While a plain hybrid vehicle charges its battery from its engine 
                  only, a plug-in hybrid can obtain a significant amount of the energy required to recharge 
                  its battery from external sources.
                <br>
                  The extra battery capacity of the plug-in hybrid is the key to reaping the benefits of the PHEV 
                  configuration. On a conventional hybrid car, that kind of extra capacity is out of reach. The 
                  car never fully charges except on long freeway trips. By adding the plug in jack with the extra 
                  battery, the PHEV has the ability to use its extra capacity by running on all-electric mode for 
                  an extended range (30 miles or more). That means that instead of burning gasoline, the car uses 
                  electrical energy (which is much cheaper). Since most trips are less than 30 miles, that means 
                  the vehicle can operate in-town without ever using a drop of gasoline. Beyond just the economic 
                  savings of using a cheaper energy source, PHEVs drastically reduce harmful emissions and also 
                  help to reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil. As with most new technologies, there are 
                  some advantages and disadvantages that prospective buyers should be aware of.
                <br>
                  Plug in hybrid batteries do cost more than normal hybrid batteries. They are powerful lithium 
                  ion batteries but with that power comes added cost. Up front, it can be a few thousand extra. 
                  However, in time the batteries pay for themselves, and then save you money by using cheap 
                  electricity compared to expensive gasoline. These batteries do have less range in them as a 
                  whole. The plug in hybrid is much tougher on the battery, causing fewer cycles for the battery's 
                  lifespan.

              <h2>BEV</h2>
              <p>
                Battery Electric Vehicles, also called BEVs, and more frequently called EVs, are fully-electric 
                vehicles with rechargeable batteries and no gasoline engine. Battery electric vehicles store 
                electricity onboard with high-capacity battery packs. Their battery power is used to run the 
                electric motor and all onboard electronics. BEVs do not emit any harmful emissions and hazards 
                caused by traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. BEVs are charged by electricity from an 
                external source. Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers are classified according to the speed with 
                which they recharge an EVs battery.
                <br><img src="../leaf.jpg" class="learnLeaf" 
                alt="image of Nissan Leaf" title="A Nissan Leaf">
                The classifications are Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 or DC fast charging. Level 1 EV charging 
                uses a standard household (120v) outlet to plug into the electric vehicle and takes over 8 
                hours to charge an EV for approximately 75-80 miles. Level one charging is typically done at 
                home or at your workplace. Level 1 chargers have the capability to charge most EVs on the market.
                <br>
                Level 2 charging requires a specialized station which provides power at 240v. Level 2 chargers 
                are typically found at workplaces and public charging stations and will take about 4 hours to 
                charge a battery to 75-80 miles of range.
                <br>
                Level 3 charging, DC fast charging, or simply fast charging is currently the fastest charging 
                solution in the EV market. DC fast chargers are found at dedicated EV <img src="../models.jpg" 
                class="learnModelS" alt="image of Model S" title="A Model S">charging stations and 
                charge a battery up to 90 miles range in approximately 30 minutes.
                <br>
                As of April 2018, the world's top selling highway legal all-electric car in history is 
                the Nissan Leaf with global sales of over 300,000 units, followed by the Tesla Model S 
                with more than 200,000 units delivered worldwide.
                <br>
                The biggest benefit of electric cars is obvious: You no longer need gas. That's a big deal, 
                since the average American spends between $2,000 and $4,000 on gas every year. With fully electric 
                cars such as the Nissan Leaf, that cost is eliminated -- though electricity isn't free. A plug-in 
                hybrid eliminates a major portion of your gas bill, as well, but it still uses an engine 
                as a range extender.
                <br>
                Beyond the fuel-saving benefit, EVs offer another major cost savings: maintenance. Since an EV 
                is fully electric, it no longer uses oil to lubricate the engine. That means oil changes are a 
                thing of the past. The same is true for a lot of other expensive engine work that could afflict 
                a gas-powered car. Brakes won't wear as quickly, either, so you won't need to replace pads as 
                often as you do on a normal car.
                <br>
                The main disadvantages of electric car ownership concern range anxiety: the fear you'll run 
                out of juice when you're nowhere near a charging station. Indeed, both the Ford Focus Electric 
                and Nissan Leaf offer a range of approximately 75 miles. For most drivers, that's more than enough 
                to get around -- but many will require a second car, if only to calm their nerves. With that said,
                modern battery technology is advancing daily.  Now it's possible to find models of EVs that can go
                200-300 miles per charge and most have DC quick charging options that can add 150 miles of range
                in less than 30 minutes. Tesla also has supercharging options that claim to be able to add 75 miles of 
                range in 5 minutes.
                <br>
                Another big disadvantage is that many drivers will have to install a charging station at home. 
                It's not necessary, however, as you can simply charge your EV at work or at various public charging 
                stations. But most shoppers will want a charging station at home, cutting into the cost savings from 
                owning an EV in the first place.
