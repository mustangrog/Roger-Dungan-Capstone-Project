        <h2 class="heading">Introduction to Electric Vehicles</h2>
        <p>Electric Vehicles (EVs) aren't a new thing.  Believe it or not, EVs have been around since 
        the early 1800s. Around the year 1832, a gentleman by the name of Robert Anderson developed
        the first crude electric vehicle. It wasn't until the 1870s until battery technology advanced
        enough to make them practical. EVs were fighting a loosing battle however. They were dominated 
        by their early Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) rivals due to current battery technology and 
        length of time it took to charge them.
        <br>
        <br> 
        Fast forward to today, with modern battery technology, and the gap to charge an EV vs. fill up
        an ICE vehicle is drawing closer.  My goal is to educate people about current EV technology, dispel
        myths about EVs, list the pros and cons of owning an EV, introduce you to the different types of
        EVs and help you choose a model that works with your driving needs and habits.
        <br>
        <br>
        The most common myth is EVs have been labeled as <i>dangerous</i> because they can catch fire.
        While this is true with any type of vehicle, many safeguards have been put in place to make the 
        possibility of this happening less likely.  In a recent article published by CNN Business, the EV 
        manufacture Tesla, claims that EVs are safer than their gasoline counterparts. According to Tesla's 
        data of their own EVs, for every 1 billion miles traveled by a Tesla brand car, there were five EV 
        fires. For gasoline cars, that rate worked out to 55 fires for every billion miles traveled.
        Operation costs are typically cheaper as well, depending on where in the country you live and
        the current electricity rate per kWh. Factor this in with no maintenance items like spark plugs,
        air filters, fuel filters or oil changes, and your cost to operate gets even cheaper. 
        To determine which type of EV is right for you lets take a look at the types and list some basic 
        differences.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Hybrid Electric Vehicle(HEV)</strong>: A HEV uses and Internal Combustion Engine coupled 
        with a battery.  These vehicles don't plug in for an external charge.  Instead they use an ICE to 
        produce electricity with a generator which provides power to a battery, which is in turn connected
        to an electric motor to propel the vehicle.  The battery can also capture energy when the vehicle is 
        coasting down hill or stopping in a process call regenerative breaking.  The most popular model
        that uses this technology is the <strong>Toyota Prius</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle(PHEV)</strong>: A PHEV uses the same technology as a HEV with
        one unique difference.  PHEVs have larger capacity batteries and can be plugged in to an external
        voltage source to be charged.  This allows the the vehicle to operate in a completely emissions free
        battery only mode.  Once the battery charge is depleted the gasoline ICE will operate and the vehicle
        then functions like an HEV until recharged.  Popular models that use this technology is the <strong>
        Chevrolet Volt</strong> and the <strong>Chrysler Pacifica minivan</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Battery Electric Vehicles(BEV)</strong>: A BEV relies on a battery only.  These types of
        vehicles usually have the largest batteries since they have no gasoline engine.  These are truly 
        emissions free vehicles producing zero emissions.  The limiting factor of a BEV is the amount of time
        it takes to charge the larger size battery packs.  There are different levels and methods of charging
        EVs.  Depending on how much a person drives and the amount of time they have to recharge is the limiting
        factor for most people with this type of EV.  We will learn more about the different charging methods 
        and times as we progress.  The popular models that are BEV only are the <strong>Tesla Model S, Model X 
        and Model 3</strong>, the <strong>Nissan Leaf</strong>, the <strong>Fiat 500e</strong>, and the <strong>
        Chevrolet Bolt</strong>.
