    <h1>Introduction to Electric Vehicles</h1>
    <p>Electric Vehicles (EVs) aren't a new thing.  Believe it or not, EVs have been around since 
        the early 1800s.  They were dominated by their early Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) rivals
        due to the battery technology and length of time it took to charge them.  
    </p>
    <p>Fast forward to today, with modern battery technology, and the gap to charge an EV vs. fill up
    an ICE vehicle is drawing closer.  My goal is to educate people about current EV technology, dispel
    myths about EVs, list the pros and cons of owning an EV, introduce you to the different types of
    EVs and help you choose a model that works with your driving needs and habits.
