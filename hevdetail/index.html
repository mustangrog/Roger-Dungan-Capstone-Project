          HEVs, as explained previously, are vehicles that have an Internal Combustion
          Engine that is coupled with an Electric Motor used to assist in propelling
          the vehicle.  HEVs have the smallest battery pack of all EVs.  The battery is 
          charged while driving using the engine, or while stopping or while going down 
          a hill where the energy is captured via the wheels.  The usual battery size
          in these vehicles are under 5 kWh.  EVs battery sizes are rated by kWh and the 
          and the larger the battery pack, the more range you will have.
          <br>
          <br>
          HEVs are designed to help assist the ICE in propelling the vehicle.  No external 
          charging is possible.  These types of vehicles are usually the cheapest entry
          point for a person to get into the EV world and are ideal for people that want 
          the best fuel economy possible without sacrificing the need to have to charge their 
          vehicle.

          Most major manufactures produce some sort of hybrid vehicle.  The most commonly 
          known vehicle in this class is the Toyota Prius.  Here's a short list of the 
          most common vehicles in this class: Toyota Prius, Honda Insight, Honda Accord
          Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima and Toyota Highlander.
          There are many more, and a list of others are available 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hybrid_vehicles" target="-blank"
          >HERE</a>.

          To get the most out of a hybrid, you’ll also have to consider your driving style. 
          Hybrids may boast much higher fuel economy figures on the window sticker, but they 
          aren’t accurate if you’re constantly flooring the car at every stoplight. That’s 
          because a hybrid’s ability to save fuel depends on the balance of internal-combustion 
          and electric power, and that varies based on the design of the powertrain, and 
          driving conditions. Because of this, hybrids tend to be ideal in stop-and-go city 
          driving conditions, but not for highway cruising.
          <br>
          <br>
          Finally, it’s important to note that not all hybrids are created equal. 
          The “hybrid” label is an umbrella term that just identifies a vehicle as being 
          propelled by two types of power supply, most typically, by a gasoline engine and 
          electric motor.
          <br>
          <br>
          A hybrid car can be a great way to save money on gas, provided you pick the right 
          one and have a good idea of how it will be used before you buy. With so many hybrids 
          on the market, and with more coming in the next few years, there is certainly no 
          shortage of options.
