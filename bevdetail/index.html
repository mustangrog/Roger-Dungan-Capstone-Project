          Battery electric vehicles, or BEVs, use electricity stored in a battery pack to 
          power an electric motor and turn the wheels. When depleted, the batteries are 
          recharged using grid electricity, either from a wall socket or a dedicated charging 
          unit. Since they don’t run on gasoline or diesel and are powered entirely by 
          electricity, battery electric cars and trucks are considered “all-electric” vehicles.
          <br>
          <br>
          When driven, BEVs don’t produce tailpipe pollution—they don’t even have a tailpipe. H
          owever, the electricity they use may produce heat-trapping gases and other pollution 
          at the source of its generation or in the extraction of fossil fuels. The amount of 
          pollution produced depends on how the electricity is made. In the United States, 
          battery electric cars charged off the dirtiest coal-dominated grid still produce less 
          pollution than their gasoline-powered counterparts. BEVs powered by renewable energy 
          sources like wind or solar are virtually emission-free.
          <br>
          <br>
          Not using gasoline or diesel also means that battery electric cars are significantly 
          cheaper to fuel than conventional vehicles. Exact comparisons depend on the vehicle 
          model and fuel prices, but driving a BEV can save drivers over $1,000 annually in 
          gasoline money. For a list of BEVs, please click

          Like other electric and hybrid-electric vehicles, BEVs minimize wasted energy by 
          turning the car off when stopped (“idle-off”) and by charging the battery when 
          braking (“regenerative braking”). Electric motors are also inherently more energy-efficient 
          than gasoline or diesel engines.

          Battery electric cars have the added benefit of home recharging. A 240-volt outlet, 
          similar to those used for clothes dryers, can charge a vehicle overnight. Fully-charged, 
          most battery electric cars have a driving range of between 70 to 100 miles, well within 
          the day-to-day range requirements of most Americans, though some BEVs can go up to 265 
          miles on a single charge. An increasing number of public and workplace charging stations 
          provide added charging capacity. Manufacturers are advancing battery and charging 
          technology.  Tesla has it's own network of chargers called 'superchargers'.  They are 
          able to, in some areas, fully charge a vehicle in under 30 minutes.  
          <br>
          <br>
          More subjectively, many drivers appreciate the driving experience provided by all-electric 
          cars. Electric motors generate near-instant torque, or turning-force, while the torque of 
          internal combustion engines increases in tandem with the engine’s revolutions (RPM). This 
          means that BEVs have extremely fast acceleration and a “light” or “zippy” feel compared to 
          conventional cars and trucks.
